# My NixOS configuration

This Github repository contains all the configuration files I use on my NixOS system, just in case that I have to reinstall my NixOS installation, or rather lose my configuration for some reason.

You can clone the repo by using:
```
git clone https://github.com/rminstrel/nixos-config
```

and then use the configuration yourself. Keep in mind that I am not the most experienced of NixOS users, but rather I love the declarative aspect of this Linux distro. Yes, Nix package manager is available on other distros as well, and yes, I DO hate the slow speeds I sometimes get without the availability of binary caches near me (Bangladesh) but NixOS builds that in as the main way of system configuration. That in of itself is peretty amazing!

You can also help me by fixing any issues in my config or even adding optimizations, or you can fork it to build your own configuration using git versioning.
